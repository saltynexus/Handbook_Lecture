# Chapter 1: Introduction
* Ocean wave energy as a sustainable energy source.
* Benefits to society: reducing fossil fuel reliance, increasing energy diversity.
* Offshore energy production reduces land usage and visual impact.

## The Role of Wave Energy in the Renewable Mix
* Wave energy contributes to increasing renewable energy diversity.
* Enhances national energy self-sufficiency and reduces reliance on imports.
* Creation of new sectors for innovation and employment.


## The Concept of a Successful Product Innovation
* Innovation needs technical feasibility, economic viability, and desirability.
* Wave energy development depends on these factors aligning harmoniously.
* Public grants and market incentives drive wave energy technology development.

## Overview of Wave Energy Technologies
* Over 250 wave energy developers globally.
* Main categories of wave energy converters (WECs) such as oscillating water columns, point absorbers, and overtopping devices.
* Technology development is active, but commercialization is still challenging.

## Business Potential of Wave Energy
* High costs of WEC development due to harsh offshore conditions.
* Need for economic viability through reduced CapEx/OpEx and proven power production.
* Importance of a strong track record for attracting investors.

## Components of a Wave Energy Converter (WEC)
* Hydrodynamic subsystem: absorbs wave energy.
* Power Take-Off (PTO) subsystem: converts wave energy into electricity.
* Reaction subsystem: anchors WEC and supports other subsystems.
* Control subsystem: automates and monitors the WEC.

## Metocean Parameters Affecting WECs
* Environmental factors: wave motion, depth, seabed composition, and tidal currents.
* Importance of understanding local conditions for effective WEC deployment.

## Key Challenges: Survivability and Reliability
* WEC survivability in extreme ocean conditions.
* Maintenance and reliability challenges in offshore environments.
* Importance of designing systems that minimize downtime and are easy to maintain on-site.

## Economic Viability of WECs
* The need for WECs to scale to multi-MW devices for cost-efficiency.
* Smaller WECs are not as viable in the long-term without technological advances.
* CapEx, OpEx, and feed-in tariffs influence economic success.

## Optimal Locations for WEC Deployment
* Key factors: wave energy content, wave steepness, proximity to infrastructure.
* Examples of optimal regions: Southern Hemisphere, North Atlantic.
* Location influences economic and technical performance of WECs.

## Power Take-Off Systems
* Different PTO systems (hydraulic, mechanical, direct drive).
* PTO efficiency is crucial for overall system performance.
* Advanced control strategies can enhance power production but increase system wear.

## Future Outlook
* Wave energy has a strong potential as part of the future renewable energy mix.
* Ongoing technological improvements needed to reduce costs and increase reliability.
* Opportunities for innovation in scaling, durability, and maintenance.

## Summary and Conclusions
* Ocean wave energy has significant long-term potential.
* Success depends on innovation, economic viability, and optimal deployment.
* WEC technology continues to evolve, with many challenges ahead.

You can also cite references that are stored in a `bibtex` file. For example,
the following syntax: `` {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014` `` will render like
this: {cite}`holdgraf_evidence_2014`.

Moreover, you can insert a bibliography into your page with this syntax:
The `{bibliography}` directive must be used for all the `{cite}` roles to
render properly.
For example, if the references for your book are stored in `references.bib`,
then the bibliography is inserted with:

```{bibliography}
