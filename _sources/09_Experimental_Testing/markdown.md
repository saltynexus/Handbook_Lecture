# Chapter 9: Experimental Testing and Evaluation of WECs
* Importance of experimental tests in validating WEC technologies.
* Testing environments: tank testing (controlled wet), test benches (controlled dry), and sea trials (uncontrolled wet).
* Different stages of WEC development require different testing approaches.

## Overview of Test Campaigns
* Objectives of test campaigns: investigate and validate performance, structural integrity, and survivability.
* Example: Wavestar WEC development involved multiple test campaigns using models, prototypes, and test benches.
* Testing complexity increases with model size and environmental complexity.

## Tank Testing
* Tank testing covers all stages of WEC development, from proof of concept to near-commercial devices.
* Key objectives: verify energy production, assess power performance, structural loads, and mooring forces.
* Tank tests typically use irregular waves to simulate realistic marine conditions.

## Sea State Selection for Testing
* Sea states are representative wave conditions used for testing.
* Selected based on the most critical wave parameters (significant wave height Hs, and energy period Te).
* Example: Sea states used for Danish North Sea testing—selected to cover maximum energy production potential.

## Testing Structural and Mooring Forces
* Tank tests help assess maximum structural and mooring forces under various sea states.
* Importance of testing under operational and design sea states to simulate real-world extreme conditions.
* Structural loads need to be verified for survivability.

## Hydrodynamic Response of WECs
* Natural period of oscillation is key to understanding the response of WECs to wave action.
* Response Amplitude Operators (RAOs) describe how a WEC responds to different wave frequencies.
* RAOs can be measured in both regular and irregular waves.

## Power Performance Evaluation
* Evaluation starts with measuring the absorbed power (Pabs) of the WEC.
* Capture Width Ratio (CWR) is a key performance metric (absorbed power per meter of wave front).
* Tank tests aim to develop a performance curve or surface for different wave conditions.

## Scaling and Estimating Mean Annual Energy Production (MAEP)
* Tank testing results are scaled to estimate full-scale performance.
* Mean Annual Energy Production (MAEP) calculated using scaled sea states and capture width data.
* Importance of matching WEC design to peak energy production zones.

## Scaling Considerations in Testing
* Froude’s Model Law is used to scale data between model and full-scale WECs.
* Scaling influences hydrodynamic behavior, power production, and structural loads.
* Choosing an appropriate scaling ratio is key to optimizing testing results.

## Sea Trials Overview
* Sea trials represent the final phase of WEC testing, exposing the device to uncontrolled real-world conditions.
* Sea trials assess performance, maintenance requirements, and operational capabilities.
* Example: Billia Croo test site for WECs.

## Performance Assessment in Sea Trials
* Sea trials allow for refining performance metrics, including MAEP and Levelized Cost of Energy (LCoE).
* Data from sea trials is used to validate and adjust earlier testing results.
* Methodologies for sea trial assessment are under development (e.g., IEC 62600 standards).

## Key Challenges in Experimental Testing
* Cost and time constraints are major challenges for both tank testing and sea trials.
* Optimizing test procedures is critical for gathering robust data within limited timeframes.
* Continued testing and innovation needed to improve WEC efficiency and reliability.

## Summary and Conclusions
* Experimental testing is essential for the development and commercialization of WEC technologies.
* A comprehensive approach combining tank testing, test benches, and sea trials is necessary to validate WECs.
* Testing informs both technical development and economic viability assessments.
