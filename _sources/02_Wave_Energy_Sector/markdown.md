# Chapter 2: The Wave Energy Sector
* Overview of renewable energy's importance.
* Key motivations: environmental impact, fossil fuel depletion, energy security, and job creation.
* Wave energy is one of several forms of renewable energy, contributing to a diversified energy mix.

## Addressing Environmental and Economic Concerns
* Climate change mitigation through reduced CO2 emissions.
* The depletion of fossil fuels as a pressing global issue.
* The uneven distribution of fossil fuels leads to geopolitical conflicts—wave energy offers localized solutions.

## The Future of Energy Systems
* Case example: Denmark’s goal of being fossil fuel-independent by 2050.
* Importance of political support and R&D in reducing costs for renewable technologies like wave energy.
* Wave energy's role in the future renewable energy mix, alongside wind, solar, and others.

## The Global Potential of Wave Energy
* Wave energy as a vast resource: 3.7 TW theoretical global resource.
* Waves generated by wind over the ocean travel long distances with minimal energy loss.
* Regional variations: Europe’s Atlantic coast has much higher wave power levels compared to areas like Denmark.

## Global and Regional Estimates of Wave Energy Potential
* Maps of global wave energy potential.
* Recoverable wave energy estimated to be about two-thirds of global electricity consumption.
* Significant potential for wave energy in Europe, especially the UK and northern coasts.

## Historical Development of Wave Energy Converters (WECs)
* Early attempts to harness wave energy date back to the 1800s.
* The modern era of wave energy research began in the 1970s, influenced by the oil crisis.
* Current focus on commercial-scale WEC development, with strong efforts in Europe.

## Types of Wave Energy Converters
* Three main types of WECs: Terminators, Attenuators, and Point Absorbers.
* Terminators: devices with large horizontal extensions parallel to wave propagation.
* Attenuators: devices perpendicular to wave propagation.
* Point absorbers: devices with small extensions compared to the wavelength.

## Locations of WEC Deployment
* Onshore WECs: fixed to the coast (e.g., oscillating water columns).
* Near-shore WECs: installed in shallow waters, often bottom-mounted.
* Offshore WECs: floating devices in deep waters, where waves are not influenced by the seabed.

## Power Take-Off (PTO) Systems in WECs
* Different PTO systems convert wave energy into electricity: hydraulic, mechanical, and direct drive.
* Importance of efficiency in PTO systems for overall performance.
* Advanced control strategies can enhance power production but add complexity.

## Examples of Various WEC Types
* Overview of prominent WEC technologies (e.g., Pelamis, Crestwing, and Wavebob).
* Description of each WEC’s working principle (e.g., wave-activated bodies, oscillating water columns).
* Technologies span both floating and fixed devices.

## Multi-body WEC Systems
* Examples of multi-body WECs: Wavestar and Floating Power Plant.
* WECs that use multiple floats or absorbers to capture wave energy more efficiently.
* Challenges and benefits of multi-body systems: increased efficiency but greater complexity.

## Overtopping WECs
* Overtopping devices like the Wave Dragon use ramp structures to capture water from waves.
* Captured water flows back into the ocean through turbines, generating electricity.
* These devices often include additional structures to focus and amplify wave energy.

## Testing and Development of WEC Prototypes
* The staged development process for WECs: from concept to commercial product.
* Real-sea testing is crucial for proving the feasibility and durability of WECs.
* European Marine Energy Center (EMEC) as a key facility for testing wave energy technologies.

## Future Prospects for Wave Energy
* Continued development of WECs through research, optimization, and scaling.
* The role of wave energy in complementing other renewables, especially in regions with strong wave resources.
* International collaboration and policy support as key to advancing the wave energy sector.

## Summary and Conclusions
* Wave energy holds significant promise as part of the global renewable energy portfolio.
* Challenges remain in terms of cost reduction and technical feasibility.
* With continued R&D, wave energy can play a critical role in a diversified, sustainable energy future.
