# Lecture - Handbook of Ocean Wave Energy

September 1, 2024

In the Spring of 2024, the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute ([HNEI](https://www.hnei.hawaii.edu/research/ocean-energy/)) received Federal funding from the US Department of Energy to rekindle operational capacity of the Hawaii Marine Energy Center (HMEC). As "Director of Outreach", my goal is to increase awareness of ocean energy activities and opportunities here in Hawaii, as well as the US Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI). Although most outreach communications will take place on HMEC's website, it is not the best platform to serve STEM content.

In the Spring of 2025, a close friend and colleague of mine, [Professor Jacob Tyler](https://www.kapiolani.hawaii.edu/department-directory/ms-dir/), and I will be running a semester long course at Kapiolani Community College ([KCC](https://www.kapiolani.hawaii.edu/)) here on Oahu, Hawaii. As per the curriculum requirements, the course fundamentally serves as an introduction to engineering and design. However, uniquely different from a conventional engineering course, the application focus will be on ocean wave energy converters. Growing up on an island in the Pacific, many kids are already highly familiar with, at least in an intuitive sense, the ocean environment. Thus, it makes perfect sense to pull this love for the ocean into the classroom and expose students early on to a growing ocean energy sector.

The semester long course will be broken up into three main sections: 1) a high level introduction of ocean wave energy to facilitate project research and foster ideas, 2) a practical introduction to computer-aided design (CAD) and added manufacturing via fused deposition modeling (FDM), and 3) experimental testing of a scaled model, including data acquisition and post test analysis. Students will then be asked to create a project poster and present at the Student Undergraduate Research Fair ([SURF](https://kapcc-research.wixsite.com/surf)). The complete course Syllabus can be downloaded here.

The required only required text for this course, shown to the right, is an open access book titled "Handbook of Ocean Wave Energy" published by Springer ([source](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-39889-1)). In the even the link fails, I've provided a copy of the book {download}`here</downloads/Handbook_of_Ocean_Wave_Energy.pdf>` for your convenience. Drawing from select chapters, the intent of this Jupyter Book is to facilitate the introductory lecture series. 


A PDF copy of this presentation can also be {download}`downloaded</downloads/2024_Heitmann_Handbook_Lecture.pdf>` free of charge for you to view offline.

Being the first time we're teaching this course, the material is subject to change and will be molded to fit course outcomes.
